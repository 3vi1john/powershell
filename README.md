#ip lookup.ps1 
takes an IP address, performs a whois, dns lookup, reputation lookup, and geoip.
You supply the IP address in a text box. PrimalForms was used to create the gui. 
I added the functionality.

#wordoc-ss.ps1 
Searches the C drive for word docx files and looks for social security number pattern. Must have microsoft word installed to test of course.
